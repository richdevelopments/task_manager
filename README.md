This task manager will be built using Flask, MongoDB, and a frontend framework called Materialize.
<br>
Built with create, read, update, and delete calls, otherwise known as CRUD calls, to a Mongo database.
This was done in the context of a Flask application.

I created HTML based user interfaces to demonstrate these CRUD calls in action.
I styled these interfaces using the Materialize framework.
